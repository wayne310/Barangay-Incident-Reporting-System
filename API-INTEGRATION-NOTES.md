# PHP + MySQL Integration Notes

The PHP/MySQL API handles login, registration, and incident submission. The browser keeps some UI and session state in localStorage, while incident records are submitted to the API.

Suggested endpoints:

- `POST /api/login.php`
- `POST /api/register.php`
- `GET /api/incidents.php`
- `POST /api/incidents.php`
- `GET /api/incidents/{id}.php`
- `PUT /api/incidents/{id}.php`
- `POST /api/incidents/{id}/verify.php`

Suggested MySQL incident fields:

- `id`
- `reporter_id`
- `category`
- `description`
- `location`
- `latitude`
- `longitude`
- `photo_path`
- `ai_priority`
- `verified_priority`
- `verification_status`
- `incident_status`
- `created_at`
- `updated_at`

Do not trust role information sent by the browser. The PHP backend must authenticate the session/token and check that only authorized officials can verify or change an incident's official priority.

## Turnstile local configuration

The registration, login, and incident-creation endpoints require Cloudflare Siteverify. Set these values in the project-root `.env` file, or configure them in the MAMP/Apache server environment:

- `TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` - the public widget key, returned to the browser by the metadata endpoint.
- `TURNSTILE_SECRET` - the widget secret key; keep it out of frontend code and version control.
- `TURNSTILE_HOSTNAMES` - `localhost,127.0.0.1` for local testing.

For production, configure the production hostname separately; do not include local hostnames in the production backend's allowlist. Incident photos are stored in `api/uploads/incidents` and are served through the authenticated `api/photo.php` endpoint.

## OpenAI local configuration

Incident priority is classified in PHP through the OpenAI Responses API. Set these values in the project-root `.env` file or the MAMP/Apache server environment:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - the OpenAI API key; keep it server-side and out of version control.
- `OPENAI_MODEL` - optional model override; defaults to `gpt-4o-mini`.

Only the incident category and description are sent to OpenAI. The browser-provided priority is ignored, and the result is stored as an AI recommendation for an authorized official to review. See the [Responses API](https://developers.openai.com/api/reference/resources/responses/methods/create) and [Structured Outputs guide](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/structured-outputs).
